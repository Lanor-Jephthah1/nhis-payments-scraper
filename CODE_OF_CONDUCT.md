## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our NHIS Payments Scraper project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

- Showing empathy towards other community members  

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission

## Our Responsibilities

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
